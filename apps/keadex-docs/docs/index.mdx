This is the Keadex documentation built with [Docusaurus v2](https://docusaurus.io/) as a standalone web application: [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/keadex/web-apps/tree/main/apps/keadex-docs).

It is integrated in [keadex.io](https://keadex.io) as a micro-frontend by using [Webpack 5 Module Federation](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-federation/).
