# Overview

Keadex provides various **libraries and extensions** to include diagrams created with Mina within the most common documentation platforms.

<div className="relative h-auto w-[30rem] max-w-full mx-auto mt-8">
  <PlayerClient
    src="https://vimeo.com/1070865333/a5d92e513f"
    playing
    muted
    loop
    width="100%"
    height="100%"
    config={{
      vimeo: {
        responsive: true,
      },
    }}
  />
</div>

By using these packages:

- You can include the diagrams using their **URL**, without the need to export them.
- As a result your documentation will always render the **most updated diagram** based on your versioning system, without the need for constant manual updates.
- The diagrams will be **interactive**, allowing navigation across various connected architectural diagrams.
