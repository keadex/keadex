# Versioning

A Mina project primarily consists of the following files:

- `.puml` files: contain the code of the diagrams.
- `.json` files: contain specifications of the diagrams, including position, size, and metadata of the elements within a diagram.

For further details about the Mina project structure, please visit [this documentation](/en/docs/mina/getting-started/project-structure).

<div className="relative h-auto w-[30rem] max-w-full mx-auto mt-8">
  <PlayerClient
    src="https://vimeo.com/1070152500/8b11627a96"
    playing
    muted
    loop
    width="100%"
    height="100%"
    config={{
      vimeo: {
        responsive: true,
      },
    }}
  />
</div>

Thus, the project only contains **human-readable code** without any binary data
or incomprehensible metadata files.

This feature makes a Mina project **easily versionable** with tools such as GitHub, facilitating the adoption of common **software development best practices** like code reviews, pull request approval processes, continuous integration, and more.
