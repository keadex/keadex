# Low-Coding

_Diagrams-as-code_ is great, but your team might not be familiar with the [C4-PlantUML](https://github.com/plantuml-stdlib/C4-PlantUML/) syntax and may not be **productive** right away.

Or your team might not be composed entirely of people with **coding skills**. Nevertheless, you may want to enable the **entire team** to contribute to describing the architectures with C4 model diagrams, without sacrificing the advantages of _diagrams-as-code_.

To overcome this hurdle, Keadex Mina provides a low-code features: you can create C4 diagram elements using just the UI, and Mina will **generate the PlantUML code** for you.

## Usage

<div className="w-full h-[30rem] my-14 border-0">
  <PlayerClient
    src="https://vimeo.com/1072366975/357ae9df0a"
    muted
    width="100%"
    height="100%"
    controls
    config={{
      vimeo: {
        transparent: false,
      },
    }}
  />
</div>

1. Open a diagram
2. Place the cursor at the line of the code editor where you want to add the element
3. You have two options:
   1. Right mouse click -> _"Add a diagram element"_
   2. Click on the icon <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faPlus} className="inline w-4 mx-2" /> in the toolbar of the editor
4. Select the C4 type of the element you want to create from the opened menu
5. Fill the form with the required data
6. Click on the _save_ button
7. The dialog will close, and the generated PlantUML code will be added in the code editor
