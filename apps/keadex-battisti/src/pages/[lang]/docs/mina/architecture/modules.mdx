### C4 Model UI Kit

Keadex-independent, it exports the [rendering system](/en/docs/mina/architecture/rendering-system) and [Fabric.js](https://github.com/fabricjs/fabric.js) components to render C4 Model diagrams.

For more details, please visit the **C4 Model UI Kit** [documentation](/en/docs/c4-model-ui-kit).

### Keadex Mina

#### Backend

##### Controllers

Controllers expose the Rust APIs and Tauri commands that the frontend can invoke. They serve as the interface between the frontend and the backend.

##### DAOs

Keadex Mina Backend adopts the [**DAO Pattern**](https://www.baeldung.com/java-dao-pattern).

According to [Baeldung' article](https://www.baeldung.com/java-dao-vs-repository#DAOPattern):

"The Data Access Object Pattern, aka DAO Pattern, is an abstraction of data persistence and is considered closer to the underlying storage, which is often table-centric.

Therefore, in many cases, our DAOs match database tables, allowing a more straightforward way to send/retrieve data from storage, hiding the ugly queries."

##### File System APIs

Keadex Mina uses the file system to:

- Store diagrams
- Store Mina's configuration files

Since the Keadex Mina Backend must be able to run on **multiple platforms**, including the **web**, Mina has an **abstraction layer** for the file system APIs.

This layer is then implemented using two set of file system APIs:

- [**Rust Standards FS APIs**](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fs/index.html): used when running in a Tauri environment (desktop application)
- [**Web FS APIs**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_API): used when running in a web environment (e.g., Mina Live)

##### Memory

Keadex Mina maintains an in-memory global state, which is used to:

- Store instances of singletons
- Cache data for the currently opened user's project (e.g., diagrams, project settings, etc.)

##### PlantUML Parser

Keadex Mina leverages the [PlantUML Domain Specific Lanuage (DSL)](https://plantuml.com/guide) to allow users to create diagrams through code.

While the PlantUML DSL offers an extensive syntax, Keadex Mina focuses specifically on the syntax needed for coding C4 Model diagrams.

Therefore, **Keadex Mina supports only the [C4 Model PlantUML](https://github.com/plantuml-stdlib/C4-PlantUML/) syntax**.

Currently, there are no open-source implementations of the PlantUML grammar available.
Keadex Mina utilizes its own implementation of the C4 Model PlantUML grammar. This grammar is implemented using [Pest](https://pest.rs/) and can be found [here](https://github.com/keadex/keadex/blob/main/apps/keadex-mina/src-tauri/src/parser/plantuml/c4plantuml.pest).

The **PlantUML Parser** parses C4 Model PlantUML code and is automatically generated by [Pest](https://pest.rs/) based on the [C4 Model PlantUML grammar](https://github.com/keadex/keadex/blob/main/apps/keadex-mina/src-tauri/src/parser/plantuml/c4plantuml.pest) implemented by Keadex.

This module is one of the fundamental components of the [Rendering System](/en/docs/mina/architecture/rendering-system).

##### Project Initializer

The **Project Initializer** provides functions to initialize a new Mina project or load an existing one.

##### SerDes

Keadex Mina handles various data formats, primarily JSON and PlantUML.
The **SerDes** module offers features to serialize and deserialize these data types.

##### Repositories

Keadex Mina Backend adopts the **Repository Design Pattern**.

As per [Eric Evans' book Domain-Driven Design](https://www.pearson.com/en-us/subject-catalog/p/domain-driven-design-tackling-complexity-in-the-heart-of-software/P200000009375/9780321125217), the "**repository is a mechanism for encapsulating storage, retrieval, and search behavior, which emulates a collection of objects.**"

Likewise, according to [Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture](https://www.pearson.com/en-us/subject-catalog/p/patterns-of-enterprise-application-architecture/P200000009121), it "**mediates between the domain and data mapping layers using a collection-like interface for accessing domain objects.**"

So, according to [Baeldung' article](https://www.baeldung.com/java-dao-vs-repository#repositoryPattern):

"A repository deals with data and hides queries similar to DAO. However, it sits at a higher level, closer to the business logic of an app.

Consequently, a repository can use a DAO to fetch data from the database and populate a domain object. Or, it can prepare the data from a domain object and send it to a storage system using a DAO for persistence."

##### Resolver

Keadex Mina Backend adopts the [Singleton Design Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern).

This pattern has both advantages and disadvantages. One notable drawback is its handling of multithreading: since the single instance is accessible to all threads and each thread is unaware of the actions taken by others on the same instance, using this pattern can lead to race conditions and synchronization issues.

To address this, Keadex Mina leverages the power of Rust for a more advanced implementation of the Singleton pattern. This implementation involves the creation of a **Resolver**.

The **Resolver** is responsible for storing single instances and providing access to them while preventing race conditions and synchronization issues through appropriate locking and unlocking mechanisms.

##### Services

Services implement the business logic, with each service focusing on the logic of a specific scope, such as AI, diagrams, hooks, search, etc.

#### Frontend

##### Components

The majority of the application's components are imported from the **Keadex UI Kit**.
However, certain components are specific to the Keadex Mina UI, such as the `DiagramEditorToolbar`.
All of these components are utilized within the views.

##### Tauri Bridge

This is a bridge that uses the Tauri API to invoke the Tauri commands exposed by the Rust controllers of the Mina backend.

##### Views

Contain the views that constitute the UI of the application.
Views are implemented as React components.

### Keadex UI Kit

It provides the Keadex Design Language System (DLS), used to build the UI of the Keadex applications.

### Keadex Utils

It contains a set of general purpose Typescript utilities used by the Keadex applications and libraries.

### Mina CLI

The **Mina Command Line Interface (CLI)** allows you to interact with Keadex Mina projects **without using the graphical user interface**.
It is a Rust-based application that incorporates a subset of the [Keadex Mina Backend](#backend) functionality and is compiled for multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

### Mina Confluence App

**Mina Confluence App** is a React application with the configuration required for the integration with an [Atlassian Forge](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/) project. This application just imports and render the **Mina React** component.

### Mina Confluence Plugin

**Mina Confluence Plugin** is an [Atlassian Forge](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/) project that includes the Mina Confluence plugin implementation. This plugins renders the **Mina Confluence App**.

### Mina Docusaurus Plugin

**Mina Docusaurus Plugin** is used in combination with the **Mina React** package and it injects into Docusaurus the Webpack configuration required by the **Mina React** package.

Npm link: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@keadex/docusaurus-plugin-mina

### Mina Live

**Mina Live** is the web-based version of **Keadex Mina**. It provides a React component that allows you to embed Keadex Mina into React or Next.js applications.
It shares the same architecture as Keadex Mina: the frontend is fully reused, while the Rust-based backend is compiled to [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/).

Npm link: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@keadex/mina-live

#### Mina Live Component

This is the the React component exported by the [`@keadex/mina-live`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@keadex/mina-live) package, that allows you to embed Keadex Mina into React or Next.js applications.

#### Tauri Plugin & Web Adapters

Keadex Mina is built with [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) and uses several **Tauri plugins and APIs** to provide features such as:

- Copy to clipboard
- File system access
- Native dialogs
- ...and more.

However, **Tauri is not designed to run in a web environment**. To make these features available in the browser (e.g., when using Mina Live, the web-based version of Keadex Mina), we provide two adapters: `Tauri Plugin Adapter` and `Tauri Web Adapter`.

The `Tauri Plugin Adapter` and `Tauri Web Adapter` implement fallback logic or browser-compatible alternatives for Tauri plugins and core Tauri APIs, respectively. This allows web-based applications to run with similar functionality where possible.

When running on the web:

- The adapters intercept Tauri plugin and APIs calls
- They route them to browser-compatible logic (e.g., using the Web Clipboard API instead of Tauri's)

This enables near-identical behavior across desktop and web environments, minimizing the platform-specific code you need to write.

#### Wasm Bridge

The `Wasm Bridge` dynamically loads the **WebAssembly version of the Mina Backend** and provides the runtime APIs required by the **Mina Frontend**.

In this way, the **Mina Frontend** can use the same API regardless of whether it is running in a Tauri or web environment.

#### Wasm Backend

The [Keadex Mina Backend](#backend) is built with Rust and is compatible with multiple platforms, including the web. The `Wasm Backend` is the result of compiling the **Keadex Mina Backend** to [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/). This allows the backend to run in a web environment.

### Mina React

**Mina React** exports a React component to render Mina diagrams. This library uses some React components of the **Keadex Mina Frontend** and a some Rust code of the **Keadex Mina Backend**. The Rust code is the compiled to [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/).
