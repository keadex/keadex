### Keadex Mina & Tauri
Keadex Mina is a desktop application created with an app construction toolkit that lets you build software for all major desktop operating systems using web technologies: [Tauri](https://tauri.app/)

At a very high level, a Tauri application is made up of:
  - A **Frontend**: you can use your preferred frontend framework. Keadex Mina uses React.
  - A **Backend**: built with Rust, this layer interacts with the **_operating system_**.

The frontend and the backend talk with each other through a Javascript bridge.

For more details about how Tauri works, please refer to the [Tauri documentation](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/).

### Keadex Mina Frontend
The **Keadex Mina Frontend** is built with React and it mainly uses 3 Keadex libraries:
  - **Keadex UI Kit**: it provides the Keadex Design Language System (DLS).
  - **C4 Modules UI Kit**: Keadex-independent, it exports the [rendering system](/en/docs/mina/architecture/rendering-system) and [Fabric.js](https://github.com/fabricjs/fabric.js) components to render C4 Model diagrams. <br/>For more details, please visit the **C4 Model UI Kit** [documentation](/en/docs/c4-model-ui-kit).
  - **Keadex Utils**: it contains a set of general purpose Typescript utilities used by the Keadex applications and libraries.

### Keadex Mina Plugins & Components
Mina diagrams can be rendered also outside the Mina desktop application.
To do so, the following packages have been created.

#### Mina React
**Mina React** exports a React component to render Mina diagrams. This library uses some React components of the **Keadex Mina Frontend** and a some Rust code of the **Keadex Mina Backend**. The Rust code is the compiled to [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/).

#### Mina Confluence App
**Mina Confluence App** is a React application with the configuration required for the integration with an [Atlassian Forge](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/) project. This application just imports and render the **Mina React** component.

#### Mina Confluence Plugin
**Mina Confluence Plugin** is an [Atlassian Forge](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/) project that includes the Mina Confluence plugin implementation. This plugins renders the **Mina Confluence App**.

#### Mina Docusaurus Plugin
**Mina Docusaurus Plugin** is used in combination with the **Mina React** package and it injects into Docusaurus the Webpack configuration required by the **Mina React** package.
