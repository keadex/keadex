### Keadex Mina & Tauri

Keadex Mina is an application created with a framework that lets you build software for all major platforms using web technologies: [Tauri](https://tauri.app/)

At a very high level, a Tauri application is made up of:

- A **Frontend**: you can use your preferred frontend framework. Keadex Mina uses React.
- A **Backend**: built with Rust, this layer interacts with the **_operating system_**.

The frontend and the backend talk with each other through a Javascript bridge.

For more details about how Tauri works, please refer to the [Tauri documentation](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/).

### Keadex Mina Frontend

The **Keadex Mina Frontend** is built with React and it mainly uses 3 Keadex libraries:

- **Keadex UI Kit**: it provides the Keadex Design Language System (DLS).
- **C4 Modules UI Kit**: Keadex-independent, it exports the [rendering system](/en/docs/mina/architecture/rendering-system) and [Fabric.js](https://github.com/fabricjs/fabric.js) components to render C4 Model diagrams. <br/>For more details, please visit the **C4 Model UI Kit** [documentation](/en/docs/c4-model-ui-kit).
- **Keadex Utils**: it contains a set of general purpose Typescript utilities used by the Keadex applications and libraries.

### Keadex Mina Plugins & Components

Keadex Mina offers a set of packages and plugins that allow you to embed it in your own applications or share diagrams externally, for example on platforms like Confluence or Docusaurus.

#### Mina Confluence App

**Mina Confluence App** is a React application with the configuration required for the integration with an [Atlassian Forge](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/) project. This application just imports and render the **Mina React** component.

#### Mina Confluence Plugin

**Mina Confluence Plugin** is an [Atlassian Forge](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/) project that includes the Mina Confluence plugin implementation. This plugins renders the **Mina Confluence App**.

#### Mina Docusaurus Plugin

**Mina Docusaurus Plugin** is used in combination with the **Mina React** package and it injects into Docusaurus the Webpack configuration required by the **Mina React** package.

#### Mina CLI

The **Mina Command Line Interface (CLI)** allows you to interact with Keadex Mina projects **without using the graphical user interface**.
It is a Rust-based application that incorporates a subset of the Keadex Mina backend functionality and is compiled for multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

#### Mina Live

**Mina Live** is the web-based version of **Keadex Mina**. It provides a React component that allows you to embed Keadex Mina into React or Next.js applications.
It shares the same architecture as Keadex Mina: the frontend is fully reused, while the Rust-based backend is compiled to [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/).

#### Mina React

**Mina React** exports a React component to render Mina diagrams. This library uses some React components of the **Keadex Mina Frontend** and a some Rust code of the **Keadex Mina Backend**. The Rust code is the compiled to [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/).
