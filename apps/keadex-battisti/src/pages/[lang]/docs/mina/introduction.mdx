Keadex Mina is an open source application available for Linux, MacOS, Windows and the web.

It is based on the **Diagram as Code** concept: you can diagram software architectures by using [C4 Model PlantUML](https://github.com/plantuml-stdlib/C4-PlantUML) code and adjust the rendered result.

Mina is designed to be used in large projects and provides features to organize your diagrams.

In the following sections are described:

- The architecture of Mina
- The structure of a Mina project
- The available features
- Plugins and components you can use to show Mina diagrams in other tools and frameworks
