# Overview

Keadex provides various **libraries and extensions** to include diagrams created with Mina within the most common documentation platforms.

By using these packages:
  - You can include the diagrams using their **URL**, without the need to export them.
  - As a result your documentation will always render the **most updated diagram** based on your versioning system, without the need for constant manual updates.
  - The diagrams will be **interactive**, allowing navigation across various connected architectural diagrams.
