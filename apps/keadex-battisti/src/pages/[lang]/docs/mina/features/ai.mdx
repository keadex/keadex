# Diagram Generation w/ AI

Mina integrates AI to **generate diagram code** based on a natural language description of your architecture.

<p align="center">
  <Image src={aiScreenshot} alt="Screenshot of Keadex Mina generatic diagrams with the AI" width={500} />
</p>

The current implementation is a rudimentary integration with the OpenAI APIs: the Mina backend sends a completion request with your diagram description, to the `gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct` OpenAI model every time you ask Mina to generate a diagram.

Since Mina is and always will be **open source and free**, and since the `gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct` **OpenAI model is not free**, you will need to configure your **OpenAI API Key** within Mina if you want to use this feature.

If you want an idea of the costs you can consider the following data:
  - OpenAI Model: **`gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct`**
  - OpenAI pricing: https://openai.com/api/pricing/
  - Number of OpenAI requests: **1 OpenAI request/diagram generation request**
  - Max allowed tokens for each request: **2048**


## What's Next?

There is a strong interest in evolving the integration of Keadex Mina with AI. The long-term goal is to provide a feature that can generate and render detailed, aesthetically pleasing, and linked C4 Model diagrams.

We will soon plan the roadmap to achieve this goal.
