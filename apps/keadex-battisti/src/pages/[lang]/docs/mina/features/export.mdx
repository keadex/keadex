# Export

Mina provides various plugins and libraries to include interactive diagrams directly into the most common **documentation platforms** (e.g., Confluence, Docusaurus, etc.) using a URL (e.g., Git repo URL), thus eliminating the need for exporting them.

If you need to export the diagram as a static image instead, you can do so directly from Mina by clicking on the icon <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faFileExport} className="inline w-4 mx-2" /> in the diagram editor.

  <Image src={exportScreenshot} alt="Keadex Mina screenshot of the export feature from the diagram editor" width={600} className="border-solid border-dark-primary border" />
</p>

Currently, Mina supports export only to the png format. More formats may be supported in the future.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Although Mina allows exporting diagrams as static images, it is suggested to avoid this approach and instead leverage Mina's plugins and components to share and display diagrams.

  If you decide to export diagrams as static images, you should version only the code of the diagrams, not the images themselves.

  In short, Mina encourages the adoption of the diagram-as-code paradigm.
