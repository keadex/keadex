## The Problem

Keeping diagrams **up-to-date** is essential to ensure they remain **useful and accurate**. Outdated diagrams can complicate knowledge transfer or troubleshooting sessions, potentially leading to **confusion**.

However, regularly updating diagrams can be **time-consuming** and require significant effort.

**Automating** diagram updates can help reduce this effort, ensuring both accuracy and consistency.

## The Solution

In addition to the [hooks](./hooks.mdx) feature, you might consider using the [Mina CLI](./cli/overview.mdx) to streamline automation tasks.

Recapping the example described in the [Mina CLI](./cli/overview.mdx) documentation: let's say you have a repository named `infra-code` containing information about infrastructure systems, such as names, technologies, and other relevant details. These details are then used in your Keadex Mina project, which is stored in a repository called `arch-diagrams`.

By integrating the CLI into a CI workflow within the `infra-code` repository, you can automate updates to your Mina diagrams, keeping them consistently accurate without requiring manual changes.

Below is an example GitHub Workflow you could set up in the `infra-code` repository to achieve this.

### GitHub Worflow

`.github/workflows/update-diagrams.yml`

```yaml
name: 'Update Architectural Diagrams Workflow'
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  update-diagrams:
    permissions:
      contents: write
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # This step is just an example. You might need to replace this step with a more
      # complex logic to retrieve updated data of your system(s).
      - name: 'Retrieve updated web application technology'
        id: 'retrieve_technology'
        run: |
          echo "web_app_alias=webapp" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          echo "web_app_tech=Nextjs" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

      # Checkout the repo containing the Mina project.
      - name: checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
          repository: keadex/demo-mina
          path: ./mina-project
          ref: main
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

      # Download the Mina CLI.
      - name: download Mina CLI
        run: |
          curl -L -O https://github.com/keadex/keadex/releases/download/mina-cli%402.0.0/mina-cli-Linux-gnu-x86_64.tar.gz
          tar -xf mina-cli-Linux-gnu-x86_64.tar.gz

      # Use the Mina CLI to update the library element and any diagrams that reference it.
      # This ensures that updates made to library elements propagate throughout all dependent diagrams,
      # keeping them accurate and consistent.
      - name: update library element and diagrams
        run: ./mina-cli --project-path ./mina-project update-container --alias ${{steps.retrieve_technology.outputs.web_app_alias}} --new-technology ${{steps.retrieve_technology.outputs.web_app_tech}}

      # Commit and push the changes to the Mina project repo
      - name: commit and push changes
        uses: EndBug/add-and-commit@v9
        with:
          cwd: './mina-project'
          message: 'Updated library and architectural diagrams'
```
