# Dependency Table

When analyzing architectures — for instance, to identify bottlenecks, assess potential side-effects when planning refactoring, or examine the level of interdependence between architectural components — you may want to visualize **dependencies** between these components in your diagrams.

Mina offers a **Dependency Table** feature that scans your diagrams to identify which ones rely on a **specified architectural component**. The **dependent diagrams** are then displayed in a table, allowing you to click on each row to **open the corresponding diagram** for a more detailed analysis of the dependency.

To open the _Dependency Table_ feature click on the icon <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faSitemap} className="inline w-4 mx-2" /> in the sidebar.
