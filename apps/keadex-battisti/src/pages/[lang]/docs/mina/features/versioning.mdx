# Versioning

A Mina project primarily consists of the following files:
  - `.puml` files: contain the code of the diagrams.
  - `.json` files: contain specifications of the diagrams, including position, size, and metadata of the elements within a diagram.

For further details about the Mina project structure, please visit [this documentation](/en/docs/mina/getting-started/project-structure).

Thus, the project only contains **human-readable code** without any binary data or incomprehensible metadata files.

This feature makes a Mina project **easily versionable** with tools such as GitHub, facilitating the adoption of common **software development best practices** like code reviews, pull request approval processes, continuous integration, and more.
