# Links

The **layering** of the C4 model enables the creation of clear and understandable diagrams. Moreover, you will often create diagrams focusing on specific systems, which, in turn, **integrate** with other systems.

By **linking** diagrams of different levels or systems together, you will enable **interactive navigation** that allows users to have a clear and detailed view of your architectures.

Mina also supports **dynamic external links**, allowing you to connect your diagrams to external URLs while dynamically passing architectural component variables, such as their aliases.

## Usage

Keadex Mina leverages the `$link` property supported by the [C4-PlantUML](https://github.com/plantuml-stdlib/C4-PlantUML/) syntax to define links between a diagram element and a diagram or external services.

The `$link` property consists of one or more links separated by a semicolon (`;`).

### Types of links

Each link can be one of the following:

- **Internal**: Internal links follow the format `DIAGRAM_TYPE/DIAGRAM_NAME`, where `DIAGRAM_TYPE` and `DIAGRAM_NAME` represent the type and name of the linked diagram, both in lower and dash-case. **Only one internal link is allowed**.
- **External**: Only `http` and `https` links are permitted. You can also create **dynamic external links** by including variables that Mina substitutes at runtime. For instance, in the link `https://keadex.dev/<ALIAS>`, the `<ALIAS>` variable is replaced at runtime with the alias of the diagram element. To see the full list of available variables, refer to [this document](../../c4-model-ui-kit/api/c4-model-ui-kit.diagramexternallinkvariables.md). **Multiple external links are allowed**.

### Allowed links

It is possible to add links only to the following C4 element types:

- Software Systems
- Containers
- Components

### Creating links

1. Place the cursor at the line of the code editor containing the element to link
2. You have two options:
   1. Right mouse click -> _"Link to..."_
   2. Click on the icon <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faLink} className="inline w-4 mx-2" />
3. Fill in the link fields
4. Click on the _"Confirm"_ button
5. Mina will add for you the `$link` property with the auto-generated value
6. Save the diagram

### Updating/Deleting links

1. Place the cursor at the line of the code editor containing the element to link
2. You have two options:
   1. Right mouse click -> _"Link to..."_
   2. Click on the icon <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faLink} className="inline w-4 mx-2" />
3. Update or remove the links:
   1. Clear the diagram link field and select _"Unlink..."_ to remove the diagram link.
   2. Delete any external links you wish to remove.
4. Click on the _"Confirm"_ button
5. Mina will remove for you the `$link` property
6. Save the diagram
