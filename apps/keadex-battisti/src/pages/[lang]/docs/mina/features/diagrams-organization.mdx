# Diagrams Organization

Diagram organization in Mina follows the **C4 model layering**. This design decision ensures that all diagrams are **centralized** in one place and organized according to the C4 model, without introducing additional grouping criteria.

However, in large companies with many architectures to describe, managing numerous diagrams can become challenging. To facilitate this task, Mina provides the following features:

- **[Links](/en/docs/mina/features/links)**: By linking your diagrams, you enable navigation between them and improve the user experience.
- **Diagrams Metadata**: When creating a diagram, you can provide metadata such as a description containing useful information to describe the context of the diagram.
- **[Tagging](/en/docs/mina/features/tagging)**: You can tag your diagrams to assign them attributes that make it easier to retrieve the diagram.
- **[Search](/en/docs/mina/features/search)**: You can use diagrams metadata (name, description, tags, etc.) or diagrams code to search for what you need.
