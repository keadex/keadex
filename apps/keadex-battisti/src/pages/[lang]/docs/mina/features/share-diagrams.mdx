## Version Control Systems

Keadex Mina is designed to work seamlessly with version control systems like Git. You can commit your diagrams and architectural elements directly to your repository, allowing you to track changes over time and collaborate with your team.

Refer to the [Versioning](./versioning.mdx) documentation for more details.

## Documentation Platforms

You can share your diagrams through documentation platforms like [Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence) or [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). This allows you to integrate your architectural diagrams into your project documentation, making it easier for your team to understand the architecture.

Refer to the [Plugins](../plugins/overview.mdx) documentation for more details.

## Markdown Files

You can also share your diagrams through [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) files. Keadex Mina provides an API that allows you to render diagrams server side and export them as SVG, making it easy to include them in your Markdown documentation.

```mdx
![Mina Diagram](https://keadex.dev/api/mina-diagram/aHR0cHM6Ly9yYXcuZ2l0aHVidXNlcmNvbnRlbnQuY29tL2tlYWRleC9rZWFkZXgvbWFpbi9hcHBzL2tlYWRleC1kaWFncmFtcw==/aHR0cHM6Ly9yYXcuZ2l0aHVidXNlcmNvbnRlbnQuY29tL2tlYWRleC9rZWFkZXgvbWFpbi9hcHBzL2tlYWRleC1kaWFncmFtcy9kaWFncmFtcy9jb250YWluZXIva2VhZGV4LW1pbmE=)
```

You can generate the SSR link from the [**Share Diagram**](https://keadex.dev/en/projects/keadex-mina/share-diagram) page or **Remote Diagrams** feature in Keadex Mina.

Refer to the [Server Side Rendering](./server-side-rendering.mdx) documentation for more details.

You can generate deep links directly from Keadex Mina.

Refer to the [Deep Links](./deep-links.mdx) documentation for more details.
