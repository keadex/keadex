# IntelliSense

IntelliSense is a general term for various code editing features including: code completion, parameter info, quick info, and member lists.
IntelliSense features are sometimes called by other names such as "code completion", "content assist", and "code hinting".

Keadex Mina is one of the few tools with a code editor that provides an IntelliSense feature for the C4 PlantUML [DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language).

With IntelliSense integrated into the Mina code editor, you and your team can code diagrams faster and with fewer errors. The parameter info and member lists will also assist you if you're not experienced with the C4 PlantUML syntax.

  Not sure if you really want to code diagrams? Maybe you're interested in the
  [low-coding Mina feature](/en/docs/mina/features/low-coding).
