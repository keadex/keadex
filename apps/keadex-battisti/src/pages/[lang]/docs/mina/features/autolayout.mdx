# Auto Layout

Architectural diagrams are fundamental for **sharing** within the team how different systems and processes are integrated with each other. These become even more important in large companies, where **hundreds of different systems** are integrated. In this case, it is equally crucial to create clear and **understandable** diagrams.

Applications with **fully automated rendering systems**, in the presence of many architectural elements, generate cluttered and **hardly understandable** diagrams, making them lose their utility.

For this reason, Mina provides **three options** for rendering diagrams:

1. **Auto Layout**: Let Mina position the diagram elements. This will speed up your work but may result in messy diagrams.
2. **Custom Layout**: Have the freedom to decide how your diagrams will look. This will slow down your work, but your diagrams will look great.
3. **Hybrid Layout**: Enable auto layout to generate initial positions, then disable it to customize them. This is a compromise in terms of speed and final rendering.

The choice between these options depends on the **complexity of the diagram**.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  If you enable the auto layout **after customizing the diagram**, all your
  customizations will be **discarded and overwritten** with the automatically
  generated positions.
