# Auto Layout

Architectural diagrams are fundamental for **sharing** within the team how different systems and processes are integrated with each other. These become even more important in large companies, where **hundreds of different systems** are integrated. In this case, it is equally crucial to create clear and **understandable** diagrams.

Applications with **fully automated rendering systems**, in the presence of many architectural elements, generate cluttered and **hardly understandable** diagrams, making them lose their utility.

For this reason, Mina provides **three options** for rendering diagrams:

  1. **Auto Layout**: Let Mina position the diagram elements. This will speed up your work but may result in messy diagrams.
  2. **Custom Layout**: Have the freedom to decide how your diagrams will look. This will slow down your work, but your diagrams will look great.
  3. **Hybrid Layout**: Enable auto layout to generate initial positions, then disable it to customize them. This is a compromise in terms of speed and final rendering.

The choice between these options depends on the **complexity of the diagram**.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  If you enable the auto layout **after customizing the diagram**, all your customizations will be **discarded and overwritten** with the automatically generated positions.

## Usage

<iframe

  className="w-full h-80 my-14 border-0"
  frameBorder="0"
  allowFullScreen
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
/>

There are different options to configure the auto layout:
  - In the modal of the diagram creation.
  - In the diagram editor.

### Modal of the diagram creation

<div className="my-5 block md:flex md:flex-wrap items-center justify-center">
  <Image src={createDiagram} alt="Screenshot of Mina, highlighting the auto layout options during the diagram creation" height={350} className="mx-0 my-5 md:mx-5"/>
</div>

### Diagram editor

<div className="my-5 block md:flex md:flex-wrap items-center justify-center">
  <Image src={editor1} alt="Screenshot of Mina, highlighting the auto layout button in the diagram editor" height={350} className="mx-0 my-5 md:mx-5"/>
  <Image src={editor2} alt="Screenshot of Mina, highlighting the auto layout modal in the diagram editor" height={350} className="mx-0 my-5 md:mx-5" />
</div>
