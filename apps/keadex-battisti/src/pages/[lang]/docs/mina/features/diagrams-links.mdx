# Diagrams Links

The **layering** of the C4 model enables the creation of clear and understandable diagrams. Moreover, you will often create diagrams focusing on specific systems, which, in turn, **integrate** with other systems.

By **linking** diagrams of different levels or systems together, you will enable **interactive navigation** that allows users to have a clear and detailed view of your architectures.

## Usage

Keadex Mina leverages the `$link` property supported by the [C4-PlantUML](https://github.com/plantuml-stdlib/C4-PlantUML/) syntax to define a link between a diagram element and a diagram.

In Mina, the value of the `$link` property has the format `DIAGRAM_TYPE/DIAGRAM_NAME`, where `DIAGRAM_TYPE` and `DIAGRAM_NAME` are respectively the type and name of the linked diagram (in lower and dash-case).

It is possible to link only the following C4 element types:
  - Software Systems
  - Containers
  - Components

### Creating a link
1. Place the cursor at the line of the code editor containing the element to link
2. You have two options:
    1. Right mouse click -> *"Add a link to a diagram"* 
    2. Click on the icon <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faLink} className="inline w-4 mx-2" />
3. Select a diagram 
4. Mina will add for you the `$link` property with the auto-generated value
5. Save the diagram

### Deleting a link
1. Place the cursor at the line of the code editor containing the element to link
2. You have two options:
    1. Right mouse click -> *"Add a link to a diagram"* 
    2. Click on the icon <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faLink} className="inline w-4 mx-2" />
3. Clear the field
4. Select *"Unlink..."*
5. Mina will remove for you the `$link` property
6. Save the diagram
